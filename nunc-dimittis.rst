======================================================================
Nunc Dimittis
======================================================================

This is the Gospel Canticle for Night Prayer.  It comes from the
Gospel according to St. Luke.  It's called "Nunc Dimittis" after the
first words of the first verse.

    Salva nos, Domine, vigilantes, custodi nos dormientes, ut vigilemus
    cum Christo, et requiescamus in pace.

    1.  **Nunc dimittis** servum tuum Domine, secundum verbum tuum in pace;

    2.  Quia viderunt oculi mei salutare tuum.

    3.  Quod parasti ante faciem omnium populorum:

    4.  lumen ad revelationem gentium, et gloriam plebis tuae Israel.

    5.  Goria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.

    6.  Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula
        saeculorum.  Amen.

    Salva nos, Domine, vigilantes, custodi nos dormientes, ut vigilemus
    cum Christo, et requiescamus in pace.

We've already studied the Latin of the antiphon.  Now let's study the
Latin of the first verse.
